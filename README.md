# ekubot
### A *nearly* pointless Discord Bot.
ekubot (stylized in lowercase) is a bot named and modeled after Ekubo, or Dimple, from the anime Mob Psycho 100. Ekubo is a sarcastic and self-centered spirit that acts almost as a spirit guide. Maybe you'll let this bot be yours?

Required dependencies:

- An config.json file with a token and prefix value
- The discord.js node module
